# Dutch-GPT2
For fun LLM side project

## Dataset

This project uses the [OSCAR corpus](https://oscar-corpus.com/), specifically the "OSCAR-2109" version of the dataset, focusing on the Dutch language subset (`deduplicated_nl`). The OSCAR corpus is a rich resource for natural language processing tasks and linguistic analysis.
